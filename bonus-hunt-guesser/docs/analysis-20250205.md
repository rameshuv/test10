# Bonus Hunt Guesser — Delivery Readiness Snapshot (2025-02-05)

This note documents the current blockers preventing a delivery-ready build after the latest review run.

## Summary of Findings

- **Parse error report**: Unable to reproduce the reported syntax error in `includes/class-bhg-db.php`. The file lints cleanly with PHP 7.4 (`php -l`).
- **Coding standards**: The project still fails the configured WordPress coding-standard ruleset with hundreds of remaining issues spread across admin controllers, view templates, and helper classes.
- **Security gaps**: Multiple admin form handlers continue to process `$_POST` data without nonces or sanitization, triggering PHPCS security sniffs.
- **Jackpot integration**: The new jackpot module relies on direct SQL composed with interpolated table names; these queries need either prepared statements or documented exceptions before QA sign-off.

## Next Actions

1. Reformat the large admin/controller classes with PHPCS-safe indentation (tabs) and run targeted `phpcbf` passes where possible.
2. Add nonce verification and sanitize/escape callbacks to every admin form (`class-bhg-admin.php`, `admin/views/*.php`).
3. Replace direct `$wpdb->query()` calls with `$wpdb->prepare()` wrappers; where impossible, add explicit inline waivers after validating inputs.
4. Re-run `vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml` and ensure it exits with zero errors prior to the final regression pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
php -l includes/class-bhg-db.php
vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml --report=summary
```

The current state still requires the remediation steps above before the plugin can be considered ready for delivery.
